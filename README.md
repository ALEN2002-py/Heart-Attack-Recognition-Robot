# Heart-Attack-Recognition-Robot
## Implementing Heart Attack Recognition using Arduino

In this project, we are implementing heart rate monitoring and heart attack recognition systems using IoT. The system 
will carry hardware having sensors with an Android application. The heartbeat sensor will allow checking heartbeat 
readings and store the data in the database which can be accessed by health workers and users using cloud 
technology. The developer may set the high and low levels of heartbeat limits and the normal temperature range.
If the readings of both sensors go higher than the specified range or below the specified range, the patient is more 
likely to get a heart attack.
We also measure the heart rate by using the ECG or EKG (electrocardiogram) waveform as the comparison result of 
the pulse sensor (pulse oximeter) with the ECG waveform. The sensor consists of an infrared light-emitting-diode (LED) 
and a photodiode. The LED transmits an infrared light into the fingertip which is reflected back from the blood inside 
of finger arteries.
